	<p><i><a href="https://mandelbrot.dk/dux">dux</a></i> is a free, open-source, and semi-portable general-purpose library for the C and C++ programming languages.</p>
	<p>The main purpose of dux is to implement a clean, morden and featureful library.</p>
	<o>Our primary goal is to implement this almost completely ourselves and with as few dependencies as possible. Therefore, dux may not be (and is currently not) as portable as many other libraries, with the currently supported platforms being:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Aarch64, FreeBSD</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>Aarch64, Linux (Previously tested but currently untested)</i></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><i>AMD64, FreeBSD (Untested)</i></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>AMD64, Linux</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Compiling</h2>
	<p>This project uses CMake as it's build system. The option <code>DUX_ENABLE_DEMO</code> (<code>FALSE</code>|<code>TRUE</code>) enables compilation of the demo program (<code>dux-demo</code>).</p>
